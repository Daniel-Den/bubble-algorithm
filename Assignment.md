# Bubble Sort Assignment


## Goals:
1. Understand the bubble sort algorithm and its time complexity.
2. Implement the bubble sort algorithm in java.
3. Use java doc to document methods.


# Programming Assignment
For this assignment, you will implement three methods. They can be found in BubbleSort.java. You will **not** need to implement a main method, for this assignment.

* ``public static void bubbleSort(int[] list)``

This method should contain your implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

* ``public static boolean verify(int[] list)``

This method verifies if the given list is already in order. If it is in order, then return ``true``. If it is not in order, then return ``false``.

* ``public static void populateArray(int[] list)``

This method should populate the array passed, with random integers.


To test your methods, you can write a main method in another file, and call the methods by invoking the ``BubbleSort`` class. For instance, one could call ``populateArray`` via the code ``BubbleSort.populateArray(_)`` and passing the appropriate parameter.

You will need to compile BubbleSort.java before trying to use the methods.

# Written Questions
The written questions can be found in the markdown file WrittenQuestions.md. They ask questions regarding the run-time complexity of the algorithm, how to modify the algorithm, and how to modify the code to sort letters instead of integers.


To submit your responses, simply modify the markdown file. Markdown is a subset of HTML that git can render easily. You probably won't need many (if any) of the features. However, you can find a cheat sheet for markdown here:

# JavaDoc
You should document the methods in BubbleSort.java. You should give a short description of the method, along with any parameters and return values. Recall that ``@param`` and ``@return`` are used to describe the parameters passed into the method and the return value.
